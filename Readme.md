# Cyberfranklin.com - A cloud based cybersecurity web application

As a part of my Cybersecurity Bootcamp course, I created a web application called Cyberfranklin.com that is a cybersecurity focused blog that not only shared my thoughts on cybersecurity concerns, but showed my understanding and ability in using the Azure cloud services.

Project Whitesheet: CyberFranklin.com

The objective of CyberFranklin.com is to showcase your expertise in Azure cloud services and web application firewalls. The website will serve as a platform to educate and inform visitors about the importance of cybersecurity.
